1.HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and block quotes for web pages and applications.
HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn't have the ability to create dynamic functionality.
HTML helps in making the basic skeleton of any website we can watch on the internet.

2.CSS 
It helps in making modification to the designing part . 
firstly making the navigation bar and then applied some custom backgrounds ,changed the font designing ,added margins and padding and also provided the webpage with some basic animations. 
Then applied containers indicating what all features are provided in the website and added the item tray which shows the thumbnail of all the books available in the library. 
There is also a application form in which we can fill out our personal details and get registered and I finished it with designing a copyright footer
